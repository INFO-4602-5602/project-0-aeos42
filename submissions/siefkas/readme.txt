I did not attempt any of the extra credit, but I was able to get most of the functionality working.

As noted in my html file, I would like to improve how this project is constructed--my limited understanding of D3 led
me to repeat code on a large scale, which seems suboptimal. My instinct from other languages was to construct whatever
objects would be in common first, and make them available to every instance in which they could be used (i.e. in multiple
graphs of the same dataset, the same scaling and axes could be used).

However, the way that D3 seems to work (at least through the examples I've seen) seem to package the query of the data and
the construction of the graph inextricably together. I am a newcomer to javascript, so I am sure I will learn better methods
as I progress. Overall, I certainly learned a lot through the project!
